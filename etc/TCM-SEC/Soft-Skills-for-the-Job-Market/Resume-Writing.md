Resume Writing Tips

Tip #1 – Shorter is  BetterIf you are newer to the industry or just out of college, your resume should be one page.If you are more senior, two pagesis acceptable.Never go beyond two pages unless you are in academia or in some form of research capacity.

Tip #2   – Pass the Eye TestHiring managers often have 15-30 seconds to review your resume.  Make sure that you are leading with the most important, eye-catching items first.  This includes putting relevant education and certifications near the top of your resume.  Do not make these difficult to find or you risk failing the eye test.

Tip #3   – Keep Your Header ConciseYour resume header should include your name, email, phone, and address (if the job is local or remote).You may include up to two links, such as a LinkedIn profile and GitHub.  Do not add more than two links. At most, your header should take up two lines and very little space on your resume.

Tip #4 – Use a Separate, Professional Email AddressIt is highly recommendedto use a separate email address when job hunting.This email address should be professional(e.g. do not have an email address of smokeone420@gmail.com).  Any combination of your first and last name works perfectly (hadams, heath.adams, etc.)We strongly recommend using Proton Mail or Gmail    for your email address.

Tip #5 – Keep Your Education ShortUtilize one line per degree.  If you have a   bachelor’s degree, it is not necessary to put your high school diploma on your resume.  The same goes for your associates (if you have a bachelor’s) if it is older or not relevant to the field. If you have a bachelor’s from an unrelated field, it is fine to leave it on your resume.If you have a masters or PhD, it is fine to leave your bachelor’s on your resume.Do not put your college courses on your resume.  It takes up too much space.Do not put your papers and/or thesis on your resume unless it is relevant to the job you are applying for.Do put your GPA on your resume if it is above a 3.0 and leave it off otherwise.Tip #6 – CertificationsLead with your best certifications.Adapt the order of the certifications on your resume to the job you are applying for.  If the job requests specific certifications, list those first. 

Tip #6   – Experience Your most recent experience should have the most bullet points (approximately 4-6).  Bullet points should taper off with older jobs.Limit your job history to three jobs, unless the jobs are relevant to your current position.  As an example, if you worked help desk four jobs ago and are now applying to a manager position, it is not relevant.  If you were a manager four jobs ago and applying to a senior manager position, it may be relevant.Utilize numbers and metrics in your bullet points.  For example, if you worked help desk, “Provided support for 2,000 end users with a ticket response time of eight minutes and 99% satisfaction rate” looks better than “Provided support for end users”.

Tip #7   – Attention to Detail is KeyEnsure that your grammar is correct, including punctuation and capitalization. If you use a period after an experience bullet point, then use a period for all experience bullet points and vice versa.  Mixing and matching shows poor attention to detail as does poor grammar.

Tip #8   – Extracurriculars Stand Out If you have ever built a home lab, written a blog, attended a conference, made a YouTube video, participated in a CTF, given a conference talk, volunteered, etc. use this on your resume.Extracurriculars show passion for the field and help you stand out amongst candidates with similar qualifications.
