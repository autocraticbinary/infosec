## The CIA Triad

- The CIA triad is an information security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy. This model has an extensive background, ranging from being used in 1998.
- Consisting of three sections: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA).
- Industry standard.

- The CIA triad is unlike a traditional model where you have individual sections; instead, it is a continuous cycle. Whilst the three elements to the CIA triad can arguably overlap, if even just one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless (similar to the fire triangle). If a security policy does not answer these three sections, it is seldom an effective security policy.

> Confidentiality

This element is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse.

> Integrity

The CIA triad element of integrity is the condition where information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.

> Availability

In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

- The main concern in the CIA triad is that the information should be available when authorised users need to access it.
