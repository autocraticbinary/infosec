# Nmap Live Host Discovery

---

## Introduction


- Nmap is an industry-standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts, and discovering running services. 

- There are different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts:
	1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
    2. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
    3. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

- Scanners:
	- arp-scan
	- masscan


A Nmap scan usually goes through the steps shown in the figure below, although many are optional and depend on the command-line arguments you provide.

## Subnetworks


- A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium.
- For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.

- In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router.
- The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.
- A subnetwork, or simply a subnet, has its own IP address range and is connected to a more extensive network via a router.

The figure above shows two types of subnets:

   - Subnets with /16, which means that the subnet mask can be written as 255.255.0.0. This subnet can have around 65 thousand hosts.
   - Subnets with /24, which indicates that the subnet mask can be expressed as 255.255.255.0. This subnet can have around 250 hosts.

- An ARP query aims to get the hardware address (MAC address) so that communication over the link-layer becomes possible

If you are in Network A, you can use ARP only to discover the devices within that subnet (10.1.100.0/24). Suppose you are connected to a subnet different from the subnet of the target system(s). In that case, all packets generated by your scanner will be routed via the default gateway (router) to reach the systems on another subnet; however, the ARP queries won’t be routed and hence cannot cross the subnet router. ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet.

## Enumerating Targets


Examples of target specification are:

   - list: `MACHINE_IP scanme.nmap.org example.com` will scan 3 IP addresses.
   - range: `10.11.12.15-20` will scan 6 IP addresses: 10.11.12.15, 10.11.12.16,… and 10.11.12.20.
   - subnet: `MACHINE_IP/30` will scan 4 IP addresses.

You can also provide a file as input for your list of targets, `nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt`.

If you want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan, you can use `nmap -sL TARGETS`. This option will give you a detailed list of the hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them; however, Nmap will attempt a reverse-DNS resolution on all the targets to obtain their names. Names might reveal various information to the pentester. (If you don’t want Nmap to the DNS server, you can add `-n`.)

## Discovering Live Hosts


We will leverage the protocols to discover the live hosts. Starting from bottom to top, we can use:

   - ARP from Link Layer
   - ICMP from Network Layer
   - TCP from Transport Layer
   - UDP from Transport Layer

Let's briefly review these four protocols. ARP has one purpose: sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC (hardware) address.

ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).

If you want to ping a system on the same subnet, an ARP query should precede the ICMP Echo.

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for network scanning purposes, a scanner can send a specially-crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP Echo is blocked.

## Nmap Host Discovery Using ARP


When no host discovery options are provided, Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:

   1. When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
   2. When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
   3. When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

- Nmap, by default, uses a ping scan to find live hosts, then proceeds to scan live hosts only.
- If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue `nmap -sn TARGETS`.

- ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems.
- On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it.
- The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields.
- To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use `nmap -PR -sn TARGETS`, where `-PR` indicates that you only want an ARP scan. 

- `nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24` to discover all the live systems on the same subnet as our target machine.

Tools:

**arp-scan**

- `arp-scan --localnet` or simply `arp-scan -l`, this command will send ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local networks.
- `sudo arp-scan -I eth0 -l` will send ARP queries for all valid IP addresses on the eth0 interface.
- scan the subnet, `arp-scan ATTACKBOX_IP/24`
   is similar to `nmap -PR -sn ATTACKBOX_IP/24`

## Nmap Host Discovery Using ICMP


- We can ping every IP address on a target network and see who would respond to our ping (ICMP Type 8/Echo) requests with a ping reply (ICMP Type 0).
- Although this would be the most straightforward approach, it is not always reliable. Many firewalls block ICMP echo; new versions of MS Windows are configured with a host firewall that blocks ICMP echo requests by default.
- Remember that an ARP query will precede the ICMP request if your target is on the same subnet.

- To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option `-PE`. (Remember to add `-sn` if you don’t want to follow that with a port scan.) 

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/25fb5fd5d2009cf69d7aae40e8fde2ec.png)

- scan the target’s subnet using `nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24`

- Generally speaking, we don’t expect to learn the MAC addresses of the targets unless they are on the same subnet as our system. 

Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you might also consider ICMP Timestamp or ICMP Address Mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a Timestamp reply (ICMP Type 14). Adding the `-PP` option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests.

`nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24`


Similarly, Nmap uses address mask queries (ICMP Type 17) and checks whether it gets an address mask reply (ICMP Type 18). This scan can be enabled with the option `-PM`.

`nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24`

## Nmap Host Discovery Using TCP and UDP


### TCP SYN Ping


We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response. An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset). In this case, we only check whether we will get any response to infer whether the host is up. The specific state of the port is not significant here.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/23e7f481f78de8d3e89ef845b747002d.png)

If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, -PS21 will target port 21, while -PS21-25 will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally -PS80,443,8080 will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080. 


Privileged users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and don’t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open, as shown in the figure below. Unprivileged users have no choice but to complete the 3-way handshake if the port is open.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/168d48701c5f872cf1930e08b32bcd6f.png)

`nmap -PS -sn MACHINE_IP/24`


### TCP ACK Ping


As you have guessed, this sends a packet with an ACK flag set. You must be running Nmap as a privileged user to be able to accomplish this. If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.

By default, port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider -PA21, -PA21-25 and -PA80,443,8080. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.

The following figure shows that any TCP packet with an ACK flag should get a TCP packet back with an RST flag set. The target responds with the RST flag set because the TCP packet with the ACK flag is not part of any ongoing connection. The expected response is used to detect if the target host is up.

`sudo nmap -PA -sn MACHINE_IP/24`


### UDP Ping


Finally, we can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.

In the following figure, we see a UDP packet sent to an open UDP port and not triggering any response. However, sending a UDP packet to any closed UDP port can trigger a response indirectly indicating that the target is online.

- Nmap uses `-PU` for UDP ping. 


Tools:

**massscan**

- Masscan uses a similar approach to discover the available systems. 
- However, to finish its network scan quickly, Masscan is quite aggressive with the rate of packets it generates.

`masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443`
`masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p80,443`
`masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p22-25`
`masscan MACHINE_IP/24 ‐‐top-ports 100`

## Using Reverse-DNS Lookup


- Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts.
- Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use `-n` to skip this step.

- By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option `-R` to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the `--dns-servers DNS_SERVER` option.

## Conclusion


- Remember to add `-sn` if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning.

| Option | Purpose                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `-n`   | no DNS lookup                    |
| `-R`   | reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts |
| `-sn`  | host discovery only              |
