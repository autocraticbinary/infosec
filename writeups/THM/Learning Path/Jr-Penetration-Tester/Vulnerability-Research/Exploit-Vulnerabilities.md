## Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research


some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner:

| **Advantage**                                                                                               | **Disadvantage**                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.                  | People can often become reliant on these tools.                                                                                           |
| These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.                                    | They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes. |
| Open-source solutions exist.                                                                                | Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.                                             |
| Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for. | They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.                                                                             |


| **Vulnerability**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security Misconfigurations | Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.          |
| Broken Access Control      | This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.                                                       |
| Insecure Deserialization   | This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed.                 |
| Injection                  | An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful. |

## Finding Manual Exploits


### Rapid7

- Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. 
- The only difference being that this database also acts as an exploit database. 


### GitHub

- Security researchers store & share PoCâ€™s (Proof of Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.


## Searchsploit

- This tool is an offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your system.
