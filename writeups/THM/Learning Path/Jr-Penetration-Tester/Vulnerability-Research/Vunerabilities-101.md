## Introduction to Vulnerabilities


- A vulnerability in cybersecurity is defined as a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application.
- An attacker can exploit these weaknesses to gain access to unauthorised information or perform unauthorised actions.
- NIST defines a vulnerability as “weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source”.

Five main categories of vulnerabilities:

| **Vulnerability**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating System            | These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.                                                                                                                                  |
| (Mis)Configuration-based    | These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.                                                                                                         |
| Weak or Default Credentials | Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. |
| Application Logic           | These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.                                                     |
| Human-Factor                | Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.                                                                      |

## Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)


- Vulnerability management is the process of evaluating, categorising and ultimately remediating threats (vulnerabilities) faced by an organisation.
- It is arguably impossible to patch and remedy every single vulnerability in a network or computer system and sometimes a waste of resources. 

- Vulnerability scoring serves a vital role in vulnerability management and is used to determine the potential risk and impact a vulnerability may have on a network or computer system. 
- For example, the popular Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) awards points to a vulnerability based upon its features, availability, and reproducibility. 


### Common Vulnerability Scoring System

First introduced in 2005, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (or CVSS) is a very popular framework for vulnerability scoring and has three major iterations. As it stands, the current version is CVSSv3.1 (with version 4.0 currently in draft) a score is essentially determined by some of the following factors (but many more):

  1. How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?
  2. Do exploits exist for this?
  3. How does this vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad?

A vulnerability is given a classification (out of five) depending on the score that is has been assigned. I have put the Qualitative Severity Rating Scale and their score ranges into the table below. 

| **Rating** | **Score**  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| None       | 0          |
| Low        | 0.1 - 3.9  |
| Medium     | 4.0 - 6.9  |
| High       | 7.0 - 8.9  |
| Critical   | 9.0 - 10.0 |


However, CVSS is not a magic bullet. Let's analyse some of the advantages and disadvantages of CVSS in the table below:

| **Advantages of CVSS**                                                           | **Disadvantages of CVSS**                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CVSS has been around for a long time.                                            | CVSS was never designed to help prioritise vulnerabilities, instead, just assign a value of severity.                                                                                          |
| CVSS is popular in organisations.                                                | CVSS heavily assesses vulnerabilities on an exploit being available. However, only 20% of all vulnerabilities have an exploit available ([Tenable., 2020](https://www.tenable.com/research)) . |
| CVSS is a free framework to adopt and recommended by organisations such as NIST. | Vulnerabilities rarely change scoring after assessment despite the fact that new developments such as exploits may be found.                                                                   |


### Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR)

- The VPR framework is a much more modern framework in vulnerability management - developed by Tenable, an industry solutions provider for vulnerability management. 
- This framework is considered to be risk-driven; meaning that vulnerabilities are given a score with a heavy focus on the risk a vulnerability poses to the organisation itself, rather than factors such as impact (like with CVSS).

- Unlike CVSS, VPR scoring takes into account the relevancy of a vulnerability. For example, no risk is considered regarding a vulnerability if that vulnerability does not apply to the organisation (i.e. they do not use the software that is vulnerable).
- VPR is also considerably dynamic in its scoring, where the risk that a vulnerability may pose can change almost daily as it ages.

| **Rating** | **Score**  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Low        | 0.0 - 3.9  |
| Medium     | 4.0 - 6.9  |
| High       | 7.0 - 8.9  |
| Critical   | 9.0 - 10.0 |

Advantages and Disadvantages:

| **Advantages of VPR**                                                                                                                   | **Disadvantages of VPR**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VPR is a modern framework that is real-world.                                                                                           | VPR is not open-source like some other vulnerability management frameworks.                                                                                                                                            |
| VPR considers over 150 factors when calculating risk.                                                                                   | VPR can only be adopted apart of a commercial platform.                                                                                                                                                                |
| VPR is risk-driven and used by organisations to help prioritise patching vulnerabilities.                                               | VPR does not consider the CIA triad to the extent that CVSS does; meaning that risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data does not play a large factor in scoring vulnerabilities when using VPR. |
| Scorings are not final and are very dynamic, meaning the priority a vulnerability should be given can change as the vulnerability ages. | _Intentionally left blank._                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### NVD – National Vulnerability Database

- The National Vulnerability Database is a website that lists all publically categorised vulnerabilities.
- In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities are classified under “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures” (Or CVE for short).
- These CVEs have the formatting of `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`.


### Exploit-DB

- Exploit-DB retains exploits for software and applications stored under the name, author and version of the software or application.

## An Example of Finding a Vulnerability


- we will leverage the “Version Disclosure” vulnerability to find out the version of an application.
