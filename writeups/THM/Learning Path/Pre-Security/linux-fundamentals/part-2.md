# Linux Fundamentals Part 2

- The "/var" directory, with "var" being short for variable data,  is one of the main root folders found on a Linux install. This folder stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system.
- The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system. 
- Unlike the /home directory, the /root folder is actually the home for the "root" system user.
- Short for "temporary", the /tmp directory is volatile and is used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice.

- Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form.
