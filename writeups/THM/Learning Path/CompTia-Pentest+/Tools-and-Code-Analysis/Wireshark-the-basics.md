# Wireshark: The Basics

---

Wireshark is an open-source, cross-platform network packet analyser tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP).

---

## Tool Overview


### Loading PCAP Files

### Colouring Packets

You can use the "right-click menu" or "View --> Coloring Rules" menu to create permanent colouring rules. The "Colourise Packet List" menu activates/deactivates the colouring rules. Temporary packet colouring is done with the "right-click menu" or "View --> Conversation Filter" menu.

### Traffic Sniffing

### Merge PCAP Files

You can use the "File --> Merge" menu path to merge a pcap with the processed one.

### View File Details

You can view the details by following "Statistics --> Capture File Properties" or by clicking the "pcap icon located on the left bottom" of the window.

## Packet Dissection


### Packet Dissection

Packet dissection is also known as protocol dissection, which investigates packet details by decoding available protocols and fields. Wireshark supports a long list of protocols for dissection, and you can also write your dissection scripts. You can find more details on dissection [here](https://github.com/boundary/wireshark/blob/master/doc/README.dissector).

Note: This section covers how Wireshark uses OSI layers to break down packets and how to use these layers for analysis.

We can see seven distinct layers to the packet: frame/packet, source [MAC], source [IP], protocol, protocol errors, application protocol, and application data. Below we will go over the layers in more detail.


The Frame (Layer 1): This will show you what frame/packet you are looking at and details specific to the Physical layer of the OSI model.

Wireshark - layer 1


Source [MAC] (Layer 2): This will show you the source and destination MAC Addresses; from the Data Link layer of the OSI model.

## Packet Navigation


### Packet Numbers

Wireshark calculates the number of investigated packets and assigns a unique number for each packet. This helps the analysis process for big captures and makes it easy to go back to a specific point of an event. 

### Go to Packet

Packet numbers do not only help to count the total number of packets or make it easier to find/investigate specific packets. This feature not only navigates between packets up and down; it also provides in-frame packet tracking and finds the next packet in the particular part of the conversation. You can use the "Go" menu and toolbar to view specific packets.

### Find Packets

Apart from packet number, Wireshark can find packets by packet content. You can use the "Edit --> Find Packet" menu to make a search inside the packets for a particular event of interest. This helps analysts and administrators to find specific intrusion patterns or failure traces.

### Mark Packets

Marking packets is another helpful functionality for analysts. You can find/point to a specific packet for further investigation by marking it. It helps analysts point to an event of interest or export particular packets from the capture. You can use the "Edit" or the "right-click" menu to mark/unmark packets.

### Packet Comments

Similar to packet marking, commenting is another helpful feature for analysts. You can add comments for particular packets that will help the further investigation or remind and point out important/suspicious points for other layer analysts. Unlike packet marking, the comments can stay within the capture file until the operator removes them.

### Export Packets

Capture files can contain thousands of packets in a single file. As mentioned earlier, Wireshark is not an IDS, so sometimes, it is necessary to separate specific packages from the file and dig deeper to resolve an incident. This functionality helps analysts share the only suspicious packages (decided scope). Thus redundant information is not included in the analysis process. You can use the "File" menu to export packets.

### Export Objects (Files)

Wireshark can extract files transferred through the wire. For a security analyst, it is vital to discover shared files and save them for further investigation. Exporting objects are available only for selected protocol's streams (DICOM, HTTP, IMF, SMB and TFTP).

### Time Display Format

Wireshark lists the packets as they are captured, so investigating the default flow is not always the best option. By default, Wireshark shows the time in "Seconds Since Beginning of Capture", the common usage is using the UTC Time Display Format for a better view. You can use the "View --> Time Display Format" menu to change the time display format.

### Expert Info

Wireshark also detects specific states of protocols to help analysts easily spot possible anomalies and problems. Note that these are only suggestions, and there is always a chance of having false positives/negatives. Expert info can provide a group of categories in three different severities. Details are shown in the table below.

| **Severity** | **Colour** | **Info**                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat**     | **Blue**   | Information on usual workflow.                           |
| **Note**     | **Cyan**   | Notable events like application error codes.             |
| **Warn**     | **Yellow** | Warnings like unusual error codes or problem statements. |
| **Error**    | **Red**    | Problems like malformed packets.                         |

Frequently encountered information groups are listed in the table below. You can refer to Wireshark's official documentation for more information on the expert information entries.

| **Group**    | **Info**                  | **Group**      | **Info**                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Checksum** | Checksum errors.          | **Deprecated** | Deprecated protocol usage.  |
| **Comment**  | Packet comment detection. | **Malformed**  | Malformed packet detection. |

You can use the "lower left bottom section" in the status bar or "Analyse --> Expert Information" menu to view all available information entries via a dialogue box. It will show the packet number, summary, group protocol and total occurrence.

## Packet Filtering


### Packet Filtering

Wireshark has a powerful filter engine that helps analysts to narrow down the traffic and focus on the event of interest. Wireshark has two types of filtering approaches: capture and display filters. Capture filters are used for "capturing" only the packets valid for the used filter. Display filters are used for "viewing" the packets valid for the used filter.

### Apply as Filter

This is the most basic way of filtering traffic. While investigating a capture file, you can click on the field you want to filter and use the "right-click menu" or "Analyse --> Apply as Filter" menu to filter the specific value. Once you apply the filter, Wireshark will generate the required filter query, apply it, show the packets according to your choice, and hide the unselected packets from the packet list pane. Note that the number of total and displayed packets are always shown on the status bar.

### Conversation filter 

When you use the "Apply as a Filter" option, you will filter only a single entity of the packet. This option is a good way of investigating a particular value in packets. However, suppose you want to investigate a specific packet number and all linked packets by focusing on IP addresses and port numbers. In that case, the "Conversation Filter" option helps you view only the related packets and hide the rest of the packets easily. You can use the"right-click menu" or "Analyse --> Conversation Filter" menu to filter conversations.

### Colourise Conversation

This option is similar to the "Conversation Filter" with one difference. It highlights the linked packets without applying a display filter and decreasing the number of viewed packets. This option works with the "Colouring Rules" option ad changes the packet colours without considering the previously applied colour rule. You can use the "right-click menu" or "View --> Colourise Conversation" menu to colourise a linked packet in a single click. Note that you can use the "View --> Colourise Conversation --> Reset Colourisation" menu to undo this operation.

### Prepare as Filter 

Similar to "Apply as Filter", this option helps analysts create display filters using the "right-click" menu. However, unlike the previous one, this model doesn't apply the filters after the choice. It adds the required query to the pane and waits for the execution command (enter) or another chosen filtering option by using the ".. and/or.." from the "right-click menu".

### Apply as Column

By default, the packet list pane provides basic information about each packet. You can use the "right-click menu" or "Analyse -->  Apply as Column" menu to add columns to the packet list pane. Once you click on a value and apply it as a column, it will be visible on the packet list pane. This function helps analysts examine the appearance of a specific value/field across the available packets in the capture file. You can enable/disable the columns shown in the packet list pane by clicking on the top of the packet list pane.

### Follow Stream

Wireshark displays everything in packet portion size. However, it is possible to reconstruct the streams and view the raw traffic as it is presented at the application level. Following the protocol, streams help analysts recreate the application-level data and understand the event of interest. It is also possible to view the unencrypted protocol data like usernames, passwords and other transferred data.

You can use the"right-click menu" or  "Analyse --> Follow TCP/UDP/HTTP Stream" menu to follow traffic streams. Streams are shown in a separate dialogue box; packets originating from the server are highlighted with blue, and those originating from the client are highlighted with red.
