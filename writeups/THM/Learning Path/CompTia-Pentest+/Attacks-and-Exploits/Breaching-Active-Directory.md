# Breaching Active Directory

---

## Introduction to AD Breaches

Active Directory (AD) is used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000 companies. If an organisation's estate uses Microsoft Windows, you are almost guaranteed to find AD. Microsoft AD is the dominant suite used to manage Windows domain networks. However, since AD is used for Identity and Access Management of the entire estate, it holds the keys to the kingdom, making it a very likely target for attackers.

### Breaching Active Directory

Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, you need initial access first. You need to acquire an initial set of valid AD credentials. Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant. In this room, we will discuss several avenues, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

When looking for that first set of credentials, we don't focus on the permissions associated with the account; thus, even a low-privileged account would be sufficient. We are just looking for a way to authenticate to AD, allowing us to do further enumeration on AD itself.

### Learning Objectives

In this network, we will cover several methods that can be used to breach AD. This is by no means a complete list as new methods and techniques are discovered every day. However, we will  cover the following techniques to recover AD credentials in this network:

- NTLM Authenticated Services
- LDAP Bind Credentials
- Authentication Relays
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
- Configuration Files

We can use these techniques on a security assessment either by targeting systems of an organisation that are internet-facing or by implanting a rogue device on the organisation's network.
